# summer_myjournal_project
Summer project to further develop skills learned in Web Application Development class:

This web application is called My Journal.
Its purpose is to allow users to upload information about their courses at university all in one place.
Unlike moodle, this is a place to store all of your current plans, from university work to plans at the weekend
to grocery lists. users can create 'entries' which are pages which are forms the user can edit.
 Users typically make an 'entry' and put it into one of 5 categories: Current Courses, Personal To-Do, 
 and Well-being Plans, to highlight the balance of the 3 most important things a student must balance: 
 work, living on your own, and relaxation.
Users can register for My Journal, allowing them to create a username, add entries,
and add reviews and ratings to their own entries to measure how well they are keeping up with their tasks,
as well as suggest a category to us that they feel is missing! Users are able
to customise their profile by uploading a personalised bio to make the page more friendly and fun,
and by adding a profile picture. All aspects of the profile can be edited except username, after first registering
for an account, by using the Edit Profile button displayed on the profile page.

Users can only navigate their own categories and entries when signed in, so the anonymous user will 
not find there is much to do.
Anonymous users can however of course sign in or sign up, or read the About Us page for more information.
